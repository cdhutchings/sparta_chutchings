### Classes

Project consists of three linked classes:

- Aircraft
- Passengers
- Flights

Aircraft class contains all details about the physical aircraft being used by the Middle Earth airline. 

Passenger class contains names and passport details of all registered passengers

Flights contains the details of each individual flight which the airline runs. Each object has an origin, 
destination, flight number, list of passengers and take off time. The class also has a list of all flight instances 
as well as a count (so that the size of the instance list can be checked)
