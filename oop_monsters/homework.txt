We are making a system for a receptionist at an airport.

At the airport we have:

- Planes
- Helicopters

^ These are both "Aircraft"

All aircraft have:

- Seat number
- Registration number
etc...

We also have terminals at the airport, who all fly to different destination using different flight companies

Flying from the airport, we have passengers:

Passengers have:

- Name
- Passport number

There are also staff:

- Receptionists
- Flight crew
- Pilots/copilots

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The passengers and aircraft and all necessary staff are linked by a single "Flight Trip"

Each flight trip must have:

- Origin
- Destination
- Aircraft (obj)
- Passenger list (obj)
- DateTime

---------------------------------------------------------------------

For the HW we need at least:

- List of airplanes
- Passenger list
- A link between the two using a flight trip

Our receptionist needs to have the following actions:

- Create a passenger
- List existing flight trips
- Add a passenger to a flight trip

Do all the relevant tests to ensure all these conditions are met. Only then can the objects in the task be fleshed out.
